        <h2>My Assessment</h2> <!--Hey Thomas!!-->
        <p>
          The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity
          is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the
          message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is
          about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a
          necessarily large amount of data.
        </p>
        <p class="alert">
          This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization
          and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized"
          chunks of data, as simplification usually does.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a
          time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once.
          Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information
          rather than the illumination of it.
        </p>
        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p>
          Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the
          information properly using HTML
        </p>
        <h4>
          Explain the difference between the "alt" attribute and the "title"
          attribute.
        </h4>
        <p>
          The alt attribute is text used when an image cannot be loaded and it's more
          about accessibility.The title attribute provides some extra information
          about any element not just images. It's not critical for accessibility.
        </p>

          the dictionary
